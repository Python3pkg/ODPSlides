PowerPoint/OpenOffice Differences
=================================

PowerPoint Has Simpler ODP
--------------------------

From my reverse-engineering perspective, 
it seems like PowerPoint makes odp files that LibreOffice and OpenOffice can read, but the reverse is not true.

Therefore the ODPSlides package uses PowerPoint templates from which to create odp files usable by all three applications.

There are minor visual differences when opening the odp files in the different applications, however,
for all practical purposes, they are identical.
